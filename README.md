# MemoryGame
My failed attempt at a Memory game. All help welcome, how can I get better?
I got the 2 at a time for two seconds, but once they matched I couldnt keep the first click from cancelling the timer that would set the background 
color back to none. I looked at the "answer" code and other more succesful projects and most of it made sense
but I'm not on that level to have that sort of thought process to naturally make some of those programming decisions to get this thing running.
